## WHAT IS LEMP STACK
LEMP is an open source web-application stack used to develop web applications. The term LEMP is an acronym that represents:
- L - Linux operating system
- E - Nginx server (Pronounced as engine-x, hence the E is acronym)
- M - Mysql database
- P - Php for scripting langiage


LEMP enjoys community support, hence it is used around the world in many highly scaled web applications. Nginx is the secind most widely used web server in the world following apache.

## HOW LEMP STACK WORLS
The LEMP stack works by using nginx web server, which listens for HTTP request and forward it to the appropriate php script. The php script generate a response which is then sent back to the user via nginx.
Mysql is used to store and manage the website data. Php communicate with mysql to retrieve and store data as needed.

## WHY LEMP STACK IS POPULAR IN WEB DEVELOPMENT
- High performance 
- Scalability
- Open-source
- Security

## Disaavantages of LEMP
- If configurations are considered Nginx does not allow additional configurations which is a downside unlike Apache as it is more flexible in this case.
- Not flexible enough to support dynamic modules and loading.
